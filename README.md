# skyrim-alchemy

I started the fork https://github.com/njsoly/skyrim-alchemy-toolbox to give credit to https://github.com/zsiciarz/skyrim-alchemy-toolbox, because I wanted the ingredients JSON in it.

Now I've found that the commits to that repo aren't counted in my contributions, which is less fun.  
Given this and that this repo is diverting completely from the original fork, other than the use of that handy ingredients.json, I've moved the code here as a standalone.
